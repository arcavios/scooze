- Python and REST APIs for interacting with the scooze database
  - Note: v1 is local only

## Usage

### Initial setup

1. Download and install [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3115/) or newer.

2. Download and install this package from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/scooze/).

    ```
    pip install scooze
    ```

3. Download and install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/).

    Scooze depends on MongoDB to run your local database.

    *You can use scooze without MongoDB if you don't intend to use any of its database-related features.*

4. Run the MongoDB server.

    ```
    mongod --dbpath path/to/db/
    ```

    *Your local database can be stored wherever you want, but make sure you create the directory first. This is commonly stored at `/data/db`*

5. Run the scooze setup script to add some data to your local database.

    ```
    python -m scooze.cli --help
    python -m scooze.cli --include-cards oracle --include-decks pioneer
    ```

6. Use scooze in your application code!

    ```
    from scooze.api import scooze_api
    from scooze.enums import Format # TODO: this reads poorly and I'd prefer scooze.catalogs or something

    deck = scooze_api.get_deck() # gets a random deck from your local database
    print(deck.export())
    print(f"Legal in Explorer? {deck.is_legal(Format.EXPLORER)}")
    ```

## FAQ

#### Do I need to have MongoDB to use scooze?

Nope! You can use some of scooze's functionality without using a database at all.
